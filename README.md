# adarshatluriwebsite
The purpose of this documentation is to help somebody who wants to build a website/webapp using Django and has the html templates they want to use or start with. This consists of the code for my personal website [Adarsh Atluri](adarshatluri.in). The website is more comples in terms of its features where it will link to my portfolio projects and if needed be able to execute them etc... This is why i am building it rather using wordpress etc...
