# adarshatluriwebsite
The purpose of this documentation is to help somebody who wants to build a website/webapp using Django and has the html templates they want to use or start with. This consists of the code for my personal website [Adarsh Atluri](adarshatluri.in). The website is more comples in terms of its features where it will link to my portfolio projects and if needed be able to execute them etc... This is why i am building it rather using wordpress etc...

## System Setup <a id="systemsetup"></a>
1. Install python if it is not already installed. [Python Beginners Guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
2. Install Git. Most machines come with git inbuilt but if its not, you will need to install it. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
3. Clone this repository on your computer at your desired location
4. Python Virtual Environment
    * Open Terminal(on mac) and navigate to the directory where you cloned the project.
    * *Replace "placeholder" in the below commands with the name of your choice*
    * Create a python virtual environment by running the command `python3 -m venv placeholder`
    * Run the following command: `source placeholder/bin/activate`
    * This will prepend that directory to your PATH, so that running python will invoke the environmentâ€™s Python interpreter and you can run installed scripts without having to use their full path
5. Since you have cloned the project, you will already have the following Django folders:
    * app
    * app/mysite
    * app/manage.py
    * *You can refer to [Django Docs](#djangodoc) to see how to create django projects and apps etc...*
